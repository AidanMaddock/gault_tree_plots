This repository hosts the code for an interactive tree plot visualizer. The app explores visually the effect of deer overbrowsing on sampled 20x20 metre plots of trees.

How its made: Python and back-end javascript
Built with: 
Streamlit
Matplotlib
Pandas
Numpy
Plotly

The app is built to run within streamlit but the code for producing matplotlib figures of streamlit is contained within tree_plots.py and is independent of the app. 

The app is hosted at https://gaulttreeplots.streamlit.app/ and will run on any javascript-enabled browser.
